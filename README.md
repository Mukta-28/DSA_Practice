# Data Structure

Data Structures are ways of organizing and storing data so that it can be accessed and modified efficiently. Common data structures include arrays, linked lists, trees, stacks, queues, hash tables, and graphs. Each type of data structure is optimized for specific tasks, and understanding when to use which one is crucial for writing efficient code.

Algorithms: Algorithms are step-by-step procedures or formulas for solving problems. They can be used to perform operations on data structures (e.g., searching, sorting, or traversing through elements) or to solve more complex tasks like finding the shortest path in a graph or determining the best way to sort a large dataset.
